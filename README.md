# career-advisory-system
A rule-based career advisory system made in Prolog

## How to use
Consult this program using your favourite prolog environment. I prefer SWI-Prolog, but if you don't want to go through the trouble of setting up a local environment, you can  also use online compilers such as https://swish.swi-prolog.org/ .

Run the advisory system by entering the following query:

```main.```

After that, you just need to follow the instructions on screen by picking whichever option number fits you best when responding to questions that the system asks.
